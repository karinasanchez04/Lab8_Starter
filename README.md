1) I would fit my automated tests in my Recipe project development pipeline
   within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. I would do this 
   because it will help me ensure that my code works before pushing it and
   potentially breaking something. It is good to know before actually 
   pushing the code.

2) No
   
3) No because unit tests cannot test how the message feature will 
   interect with another user on an application/feature level

4) yes because we can set up a test that has a message containing
   more than 80 characters then we can see if the max message 
   length feature is being activated.
